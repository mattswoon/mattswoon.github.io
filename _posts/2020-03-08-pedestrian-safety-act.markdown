# Get rid of jaywalking

Jaywalking isn't a thing - the idea that it's a crime to cross the road under certain circumstances is a ridiculous invention of the
car industry.

Sure, as a society we need an effective deterrant against people running out in front of cars so suddenly that even the best drivers can't
help but hit them, but we have a really good one already - death. You make a mistake in front of a car, you die, there's already a really
good deterrant! How does a $70 fine change things?

# Assumed liability for drivers


# Car safety standards


# Continuous footpath treatments


# Low car zoning


# Slower residential streets


# Street design consistant with speed limit


# Road space constancy
