# Irish
This game probably has a lot of names, I've not met many who call it Irish.

Everyone puts clues into a bowl, they can be anything: a celebrity, a character, an event, an emotion...
Then there's three rounds where everyone takes at turn at pulling clues out of the bowl and performing them to some other people.
In each round the mode of performance changes
 1) use any words that aren't written on the clue
 2) use one word and and one word only
 3) charades

You can invent more rounds if you want, the point is that successful performances don't need to 
describe the clue precisely but you can use in-jokes and throw backs to the previous rounds to help the person guessing.

# Quarantine
With the global pandemic in full swing and all this talk of flattening the curve, I haven't been able
to gather with a large enough group of friends to play.

So I made a discord bot so we can play it virtually.

The bot, named Yeats because he was Irish and the special topic of one of my friends when she went on the hard quiz,
manages the bowl of clues, the turn order and showing clues to the person who's performing that turn.

Yeats is written in JavaScript and I've never written JavaScript before,
so while I'm showing you how I've done this, this is 
not supposed to be a tutorial!

Those who don't care and just want to see the code, 
it's on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mattswoon/yeats).

# Make a discord bot

Creating a discord bot is pretty straightforward, just follow the instructions over [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html).

All we need is the client id, and client secret, which I've saved to a file in my repository called `.profile`, which I can `source` to add these
as environment variables.

{% highlight bash %}
export CLIENTID="000000000000000"
export TOKEN="SoMeChArAcTeRsAnDPuNcTuaTioNandStuFf"
{% endhighlight %}

# Bot basics

I'd not really done any javascript programming before but some discord bot tutorials got me up and running. The process was something like

  1. Install [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [`npm`]([200~https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and whatever
  2. Run `npm init` and follow the instructions
  2. `npm install discordjs`
  3. Start coding

The basics of yeats is to connect using the above client id and secret token, then listen for messages and update the game state accordingly. 
So it all started off looking something like

{% highlight js %}
const Discord = require('discord.js');
client_id = process.env.CLIENT_ID;
token = process.env.TOKEN;
console.log(`Connecting with client_id=${client_id} and token=${token}`);
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.once('ready', () => {
  console.log('Connected and ready');
});

client.on('message', (message) => {
  if (message.channel.type == 'text' & message.content === 'Hello yeats') {
    message.reply(`Hello ${message.author}`)
  };
});
{% endhighlight %}

# Yeats game state

To run the game there's a number of different classes I've used to record various aspects of the game state, they are
  
  * `Game`: Overall game state - what round we're in (many words, one word, charades), who are the players, the current turn state, the bowl (where clues are kept) state, the channel to send messages to, 
  whether the game is locked or not (when locked you can't add new clues or players)
  * `Bowl`: The collection of clues, which ones have been solved and which ones remain unsolved
  * `Turn`: Info about the current turn - who's performing to whom, whether the turn is ready, running or finished, which clues have been solved, which clue is currently being shown
  * `Players`: State of the turn order - who's playing, the turn queue, a map of who'll be perform and who'll be guessing
