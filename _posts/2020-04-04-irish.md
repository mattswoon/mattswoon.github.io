# Irish
This game probably has a lot of names, I've not met many who call it Irish.

Everyone puts clues into a bowl, they can be anything: a celebrity, a character, an event, an emotion...
Then there's three rounds where everyone takes at turn at pulling clues out of the bowl and performing them to some other people.
In each round the mode of performance changes
 1) use any words that aren't written on the clue
 2) use one word and and one word only
 3) charades

You can invent more rounds if you want, the point is that successful performances don't need to 
describe the clue precisely but you can use in-jokes and throw backs to the previous rounds to help the person guessing.

# Quarantine
With the global pandemic in full swing and all this talk of flattening the curve, I haven't been able
to gather with a large enough group of friends to play.

So I made a discord bot so we can play it virtually.

The bot, named Yeats because he was Irish and the special topic of one of my friends when she went on the hard quiz,
manages the bowl of clues, the turn order and showing clues to the person who's performing that turn.
