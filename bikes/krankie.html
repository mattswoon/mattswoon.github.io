            <h1>Krankie Cargo Trike</h1>
            <p>
                In 2022 we moved to an apartment and keeping all five bikes become a bit difficult. 
                At this stage I had my main bike for riding around town, the <a href="./surly.html">Surly disc trucker</a>,
                a road bike for fitness, the <a href="./carrera.html">Carrera</a>, my vintage <a href="./speedwell.html">Speedwell</a>,
                the big, boxy <a href="./tribe.html">Tribe bikes original</a> and the folding <a href="./3sixty.html">3sixty brompton rip-off</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our new apartment had a car space, but leaving all those bikes there wasn't very secure. Plus,
                we had a baby on the way and we decided it would be practical to have a car which would have to
                take up the majority of the car space. I really don't like owning a car, but I also had no idea
                what babies need out of their transport solutions, so it really did feel practical.
            </p>
            <p>
                I rationalised the purchase of a car by telling myself it was a good time to consolidate my bikes,
                and to pay proper money to get the right one that can fill many needs.
                I loved having a light weight road bike, but I can also get fit by riding something
                big, heavy and practical. I loved the size of the boxy Tribe bike, but it's not the most nimble machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I sold the <a href="./carrera.html">Carrera</a>, the <a href="./surly.html">Surly</a> and the <a href="./tribe.html">Tribe</a>
                and used the money (plus some more) to by a <a href="https://www.krankie.com.au/">Krankie whip e1</a>. It's a cargo bike, so it
                can carry heaps of stuff (though not as much), including a baby, like the <a href="./tribe.html">Tribe</a> could. It tilts around 
                corners, so it's nimble (though not as much) like the <a href="./surly.html">Surly</a> or <a href="./carrera.html">Carrera</a>. 
                And it's heavy (though not too heavy) so I can still get tree trunk thighs from riding it. This would be the bike for everything, 
                even if it's not so perfectly suited to each task, it does <i>everything</i> well enough.
