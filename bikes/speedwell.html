            <h1>Speedwell Racer</h1>
            <p>
                This bike was donated to me by my grandparents' neighbour. I'm its second owner. According
                to its first owner, it was purchased in 1951 and the serial number under the bottom bracket
                corroborates this, suggesting the frame was built in Feb 1948. The saddle that was originally
                installed was from the Wright Saddle Company, a company that was amalgamated into Brooks Saddles
                in 1962
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the parts have since been replaced - the fork was bent, the saddle's leather decayed 
                such that the rivets poked into your butt, the steel rims were, well, steel and the Sturmey Archer 
                hub laced into them give up
            </p>
            <p>
                In its current configuration it sports a Shimano nexus 8 hub with a matching crankset, a Shimano
                SP8 dynamo hub and a Soma
                porteur front rack, making it a very practical but classic styled bike

                    My first effort at making the Speedwell rideable. Nexus 8 rear hub that replaced the
                    busted Sturmey Archer AW. Sidewall dynamo for lights and an aluminium front rim

                    As the bike arrived. I had a few Sturmey Archer parts lying around to get it going,
                    but unfortunately the hub didn't survive long. I kept the original shifter on there
                    even when it wasn't functional because it's just so beautiful

                    This actually after the Nexus 8 hub (which has since returned) as I managed to get
                    a 1972 Sturmey Archer AW wheelset, which I thought matched nicely with the rest of the bike
